# bagging_boosting_algorithm



## Getting started

Here we are trying to explore the basics of Gradient Boosting Algorithm. 

In Boosting Algorithm, the weak learners are trained sequentially by assigning more weights to the misclassified instances.

Here we will perform Featuring Engineering as below 
- Feature Transformation 
- Feature Generation 
- Feature Selection 

Also we will be performing the Hyperparameter tuning as below to select the most relevangt features from
- GridSearchCV 
- RandomSearchCV 
- Bayesian Optimization
